# Verilog Hackathon Education Kit Manual
## About This Manual  
> [!NOTE]üöß- ‚ùé- Assigned - STEAM Clown will update this later
  
This Manual and labs are a comprehensive introduction to Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL), designed for both beginners and experienced engineers looking to deepen their understanding of digital system design. Whether you're new to Verilog or aiming to strengthen your skills, this course offers a solid foundation in modeling, simulating, and synthesizing digital logic. You‚Äôll learn how to describe complex hardware systems using Verilog, with hands-on experience targeting both FPGA and ASIC platforms.   

Through progressive modules, real-world labs, and capstone projects, you'll gain practical skills applicable to embedded systems, electronics engineering, and chip design industries. This course balances conceptual understanding with industry-relevant application, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.  

This Verilog Manual will walk you through a set of Labs and Exercises that will quickly let you see the results of your Verilog code implemented in hardware.  You will learn through hands-on-labs that will take you from simple Verilog syntax to more complex structures. The Lessons will explain the code, and the Labs will provide challenges implementing the concepts from the Lessons. This Tutorial will not go very deep into Simulation or Testbenches.  The goal is to teach basic Verilog syntax, and quickly see its implementation in the kit Hardware.  

While the Verilog design flows described in this Manual can target multiple FPGAs boards & ASIC tools flows, most design flows described in this manual,  will target the Gowin Sipeed Tang Nano 9K FPGA Development Board (GOWIN GW1NR-9)  


## Introduction - Verilog Hackathon Education Kit

**Verilog** is a hardware description language (HDL) used to describe and model digital systems. Instead of drawing schematics, engineers can write Verilog code to define how circuits behave and how they‚Äôre built. It is useful when designing systems like processors, memory controllers, or digital signal processing blocks. You can design, build, and parameterize a hardware description of something built from digital logic.

### Design Abstraction Levels in Verilog
One of Verilog‚Äôs strengths is that it lets you describe hardware at different levels of detail, depending on where you are in the design process. The three most common levels are:
* **Behavioral Level** ‚Äì Describes what the system should do, using high-level control structures like if, case, and always. Verilog is an abstraction of the described logic, which can be parameterized, so make code portable and flexible.

  At this level, the designer focuses on what the system should do rather than how it will be built. The description is written using code that looks more like a sequence of instructions‚Äîthese describe behavior over time, usually inside always blocks or with the help of functions and tasks. Think of this like writing a recipe without worrying about the kitchen layout. The actual structure of the hardware isn‚Äôt considered here‚Äîonly the operations and flow.
* **Register-Transfer Level (RTL)** ‚Äì Focuses on how data moves between registers and what operations are performed on that data. Most Verilog RTL descriptions are clocked by a system clock. This RTL is the most widely used level for synthesis (turning your design into hardware).

  This is the level where most real hardware designs are written. It deals with how data moves between registers and what logical or arithmetic operations are performed in between. It‚Äôs all synchronized to a clock. RTL is ‚Äúsynthesizable,‚Äù which means you can use it to generate real hardware. In modern terms, if a block of Verilog code can be turned into a circuit by a synthesis tool, it qualifies as RTL.
* **Gate level** ‚Äì This is the lowest level, where you describe the circuit in terms of individual logic gates and their connections. You usually don‚Äôt write this by hand‚Äîit‚Äôs often generated by synthesis tools.

  Here, the design is broken down into individual logic gates‚ÄîANDs, ORs, NOTs, etc.‚Äîand the way they are connected. Signals are treated as having fixed logical values (0, 1, X for unknown, and Z for high-impedance). Gate-level code isn‚Äôt usually written by hand. It‚Äôs typically produced by synthesis tools, which convert RTL code into a detailed gate-level representation (called a netlist). This version is useful for simulations that need to consider exact timing, but it's not practical for initial design work.

Verilog is widely used because it scales well with complexity. It's much easier to manage a large project in Verilog than with a schematic. Designs written in Verilog are portable. They don‚Äôt depend on a specific chip or manufacturing process, which makes it easier to reuse and adapt them to FPGA or ASIC design flows.    

Verilog gives hardware engineers a way to write and test their designs using code. This approach makes debugging, simulation, and development faster and more flexible.  This is important for modern parameterized digital systems that would be impractical to handle graphically with Schematics.  

### ASIC vs FPGA: What‚Äôs the Difference?

> [!NOTE]üöß- ‚ùé Max is working on this

ASIC chip is manufactured from library elements (that is a list of
very basic logic primitives like INV, AND, OR, different types of flip-flops
that could be used). Types, quantities, placement and connections between the
elements are design specific.

On the other hand, FPGA chip is manufactured with reconfigurable logic
elements, and the Verilog design is mapped on pre-existing logic and then
connected accordingly. Instead of making combinational logic out of certain
primitives, FPGA utilizes LUTs (lookup tables) that allow configuring generic
table into any logic function.

So on FPGA you are limited with existing number of LUTs, memories, and other
utility blocks like multipliers, while for ASIC you can use any number of
library elements as long as you have area on the die to fit them.

FPGA is a great platform for prototyping, because you can easily
reconfigure the chip after making changes in Verilog source code. Meanwhile
ASIC is a huge commitment, because after sending the final design to the
factory you have to wait for several months before the first batch of chips
would be made. And if there would be a fault in the design, a fix would cost a
lot of additional time and money.

The same Verilog design would be able to reach much higher clock frequency in
ASIC than on FPGA, due to length of FPGA interconnect fabric, LUT delay and
fixed placement of elements affecting timing.

### Verilog Design Flow Overview

> [!NOTE]üöß- ‚ùé Max is working on this

![OpenROAD layout result](images/openroad_layout.png)

On a high level, typical design flow has these stages:

* **RTL design** - Writing Verilog code
* **Verification** - Running Verilog code in simulation with a test program,
that checks the output of RTL against software model
* **Synthesis** - Converting Verilog description into a gate-level netlist of
primitives for target architecture. Netlist specifies elements and connections
between them, they are not physically placed yet.
* **Place and Route** - Assigning elements a place on the chip, then routing
them together

* [ASIC specific] **GDSII** - Final topology file is created that is sent to the
factory
* [FPGA specific] **Bitstream generation** - Generate bitstream and upload to
the board

> [!NOTE] - The following are the Labs that are in the [Basic Music - Hackation](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/tree/main) in the [Problems](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/tree/main/hackathon/problems) directory.  What other labs should we have to teach basic Verilog?  
> [!NOTE] - STEAM CLown - I think that we should have a few more Labs to show using the GPIO board.  Also, maybe we should change the order of the labs, so we can do all the labs focused on the GPIO module before we start looking at the Display. Thoughts?  

### Gates & Muxes
#### Gates & Muxes Introduction
In this first set of Verilog Labs, you are going to learn about Verilog **Logic Gates** and **Multiplexers** (Mux).  

**Logic gates** are the building blocks of digital circuits. They process binary input values (0 or 1) and produce binary outputs based on specific logical rules. You use logic gates to build everything from simple decision-making circuits to complex CPUs and FPGAs.
* Learn how to create simple logic gates using Verilog.
* Use wire and assign statements to build AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates.
* Control onboard LEDs using push button inputs to visualize the gate behavior.

A **Multiplexer** (MUX) is a digital switch that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output, based on control (select) signals.
* Build a 2-to-1 MUX using assign out = sel ? in1 : in0;
* Observe how changing the select signal affects the output LED
* Learn how to extend MUX structures to support more inputs or wider data

In the following labs you will explore the Verilog syntax and coding structurs to build Logic Gates and Mux's

#### Logic Gates Verilog Code
Logic gates form the foundation of all digital electronics. These basic building blocks process two or more binary input values/signals (0 and 1) and produce a single binary output based on logical rules. Gates like AND, OR, and XOR enable a wide range of operations.   

They can be simple LED control to complex logic. In Verilog, logic gates are implemented using continuous assignments (assign) and basic bitwise operators such as &, |, and ^. The following labs will introduces you to the Verilog syntax used to model and test these gates using Verilog on an FPGA platform, preparing you to build decision making circuits.  

This set of labs will introduce and let you build Verilog code to implement six fundamental logic gates. You will have an opertunity to build AND, OR, XOR, NAND,  NOR, and XNOR Verilog implementations, connecting Push Button switches to LED's.   

Each gate processes two binary inputs (0 = LOW, 1 = HIGH) and produces a binary output based on a specific logical rule. Let's take a look at the Logic Gate logical rules:
#### AND 
An **AND** gate outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1. This gate is used when multiple conditions must be true to activate a signal. An example would be requiring two buttons to be pressed simultaneously.  
**Logical Rules**  
| Gate     | Symbol | Description                                 | Output Rule |  
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |   
| **AND**  | `&`    | Output is `1` only if **both inputs are 1** | a & b       |

**Verilog Example**  
```Verilog
assign led[0] = key[0] & key[1];
```

**Logic Diagram**  
<pre>   key[0] ----\ 
               AND ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----/ </pre>

**Truth Table**  
| Input[1] | Input[0] | Output (AND) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0            |
| 0       | 1       | 0            |
| 1       | 0       | 0            |
| 1       | 1       | 1            |  

#### OR 
An **OR** gate outputs 1 if at least one input is 1. It‚Äôs used when any of several inputs can activate a result.  An example would let an ouput LED turn on if either button A or button B were presed.  Only one of the inputs needs to be active to create a logical result of a 1 on the output.  

**Logical Rules**  
| Gate     | Symbol | Description                                | Output Rule |  
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |   
| **OR**  | \|    | Output is `1` if **at least one input is 1** | a \| b      |

**Verilog Example**  
```Verilog
assign led[1] = key[0] | key[1];  
```

**Logic Diagram**  
<pre> key[0] ----\ 
             OR ---> led[0] 
 key[1] ----/ </pre>

**Truth Table**  
| Input[1] | Input[0] | Output (OR) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0            |
| 0       | 1       | 1            |
| 1       | 0       | 1            |
| 1       | 1       | 1            |  

[!NOTE] I'll add the XOR, NOR,NAND, XNOR later

**Logic Gates Verilog Code Introduction**  
If you follwoed the GITHub clone instructions, you should have the following directory path:

This section of the Verilog file defines all the Inputs and Outputs of the top level block.  Think of these as physical pins comming into or out of your Top Level Verilog Block.  

```
input  logic [7:0] key,
output logic [7:0] led,
```
**inout** defines the direction of the signal pin, **logic** defines the type of "wire", \[7:0\] defines how many signals are generated in this "bus", and **key** is the name of the signals.

**output** defines the direction of the signal pin, **logic** defines the type of "wire", \[7:0\] defines how many signals are generated in this "bus", and **led** is the name of the signals.

When this code is synthisized, if will generate the following pins/wires you can connect to:  
key[0]  
key[1]  
key[2] 
key[3]  
key[4] 
key[5] 
key[6] 
key[7] 

led[0]  
led[1]  
led[2]  
led[3]  
led[4]  
led[5]   
led[6]
